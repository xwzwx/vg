                <p>An official employed by the region's Ministry of Transportation and Roadways was tasked with selecting a contractor to refurbish the seats in the region's passenger trains. In the end, the decision was between the Jigou Zuowei Group and Tielu Shushidu Corporation. The official decided to prefer the bid from Tielu Shushidu Corporation. In the bidding process, Tielu submitted a report that showed that 40% of their technicians had official certifications from the China Rail Conductor and Crew Installation Certification Center. The CRCICC's certification process includes a rigorous examination which verifies that the technicians it certifies have the necessary experience to install seating correctly, meeting all safety standards.</p>
                <p>The news of the selection of Tielu Shushidu Corporation was met with skepticism and later outrage when it became widely known that the official selected a contractor whose technicians were more likely than not to be unqualified.</p>

             <div class="prompt" style="background-color: #f0f5fa; border-left-color: var(--primary-color);">
                <p>A manufacturer of computer processors, CRS, suffered several quarters of contraction of its business due to a highly competitive market. The manufacturer's primary competitor had recently made breakthroughs in design which improved both chip yield and chip efficiency. These advantages allowed the competitor to release products that both performed better and cost less than the chips produced by CRS. Given the high costs and uncertain timeframe of research and development, the executive board of CRS considered different plans to regain the company's previously held design advantage. The executive board reasoned that because of the competitor's advantage in product quality and price, CRS needed a net increase in outside investment in the company to fund new R&D initiatives. The CRS executives decided that they should negotiate new terms for all future outside investments which would reward long-term investments with a higher rate of return, but which would penalize short-term withdrawals of capital. The board expects that CRS will be able to hold on to current investors and attract long-term institutional investors who would fund the next generation of their products.</p>

            <p>Which of the following, if true, would most significantly undermine the executive board's decision?</p>

            <div class="prompt" style="background-color: #f0f5fa; border-left-color: var(--primary-color);">
                <p>A man living in Montana was taking a road trip to see his sister in Georgia. While driving through Tennessee, his car started making unusual and alarming noises, and he stopped in Murfreesboro, Tennessee to have his car inspected by a mechanic. The mechanic evaluated the car and made a series of repairs. The driver proceeded to drive toward his sister's home. After crossing the state line into Georgia, the car suddenly lost power steering, and the man drove off the road, crashing into a tree. The man suffered a broken collarbone, three broken ribs, and a punctured lung. Additionally, his car was totaled in the accident.</p>
                <p>After returning home from the hospital, the man sued the mechanic in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, alleging that the mechanic was grossly negligent and failed to repair the car to a safe condition. The mechanic moved to dismiss the Montana driver's action due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The Montana court denied the mechanic's motion and set dates for discovery and trial. After having his motion denied, the mechanic appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss the case to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

        <!-- ======================= Question 4 ======================= -->
        <section class="question-block">
            <h2 class="question-title">Question 4</h2>
            <p>Consider the following legal scenario:</p>
            <div class="prompt" style="background-color: #f0f5fa; border-left-color: var(--primary-color);">
                <p>A state law in Oregon provides various levels of funding to cover the cost of certain prescription medicines for residents who fall below an annual income threshold. The law is written to allow the distribution of funds for anyone earning less than $18,000 per year, with an annual cap on the amount of assistance any individual can claim in a calendar year. The funds are eligible for any adult who has resided in the state for more than one year, with a separate provision that allows for additional assistance for children of low-income adults. The law also has a residency duration exception for medications that are deemed necessary for emergency treatment.</p>
                <p>A man from neighboring Idaho moved to Oregon in July, and started work as a part-time assistant for a roofing company that specializes in renovating brick chimneys. Ordinarily this work requires licensure and bonding from the state, but the man did not complete the necessary steps to obtain a license for this work. Two months into his new job, the man fell from a ladder and badly sprained his ankle. As a result of the fall, the man also suffered muscle strains in his torso and lower back, resulting in persistent mild pain and infrequent muscle spasms that limited his ability to do manual labor.</p>
                <p>A few weeks after the injury, in October, the man consulted with a physician. The physician recommended the man attend weekly physical therapy sessions and to fill a prescription for a muscle relaxant drug. The man sought assistance from the prescription drug fund as he was unable to afford the muscle relaxers that his physician prescribed. The man's income for the year was only $7,000; given his physical condition, it would be unlikely that he would exceed the $18,000 annual income cutoff.</p>
                <p>The man was denied assistance from the fund, as he was a resident of Oregon for less than one year at the time of his request, and because the treatment of the man's symptoms did not meet the emergency treatment exemption in the law. He got in touch with a law firm which took on his case pro-bono, and he sued the state of Oregon seeking to overturn the law that prohibits the use of funds for his prescription. The state filed a motion to dismiss the man's action based on standing.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Is it likely that the man's action will result in the law being overturned?</p>

        <section class="question-block">
            <h2 class="question-title">Question 5</h2>
            <div class="prompt" style="background-color: #f0f5fa; border-left-color: var(--primary-color);">
                <p>The three people had been long term renters of units 2C and 2D at the Royal Crest Motor Court. A significant amount of foot traffic was associated with the two motel rooms, and police came to suspect that the three people were engaged in drug dealing. After observing the activity from a nearby grocery store parking lot for several weeks, the police determined that the three people were most active in the early evening hours, but were typically asleep by noon on most days.</p>
                <p>Without obtaining a warrant, the police approached the motel manager and requested access to the rooms based on their suspicion. The manager complied, giving the police keys to the rooms. The police approached the motel rooms and knocked on the doors, loudly announcing their presence, asking the occupants to speak with them. Two minutes after knocking on the door, the police claimed they heard shouting and cursing, and then heard a toilet being flushed repeatedly. The police used the keys provided by the motel manager to make entry into the rooms, and saw two of the people dumping white powder from a torn paper package into the toilet of room 2C. The police drew their weapons and ordered the pair to stop and to drop what they were holding. In room 2D, the police found the third person soundly asleep.</p>
                <p>The police took all three people into custody. A subsequent search of rooms 2C and 2D revealed seven ounces of powdered heroin in room 2C, heroin powder and residue in the room's bathroom and toilet, and several torn paper packages that tested positive for heroin residue. No packaged drugs were found in room 2D, but trace amounts of marijuana and heroin were found in the room. The three people were charged with possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, tampering with evidence, conspiracy to distribute narcotics, and possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>
                <p>An attorney representing the trio filed a motion to suppress the drugs, drug paraphernalia, and drug residue evidence. At the hearing for the motion to suppress, the defense argued several points, including that the police didn't secure a warrant prior to entering the hotel rooms, that the police officers who entered room 2C displayed reckless behavior by brandishing their weapons, and that there was no way that the police could have heard the flushing of the toilet, making their entry completely unjustified. Upon questioning by the judge, the State acknowledged that while the police were wearing bodycams during the arrest, a technical problem caused the audio recording to fail, meaning that the state was relying on officer testimony regarding the sound of the toilet flushing.</p>

        <!-- ======================= Question 6: Response Comparison ======================= -->
        <section class="question-block">
            <h2 class="question-title">Question 6: Response Comparison</h2>
            <p>Suppose you're working on a task where you are asked to evaluate outputs from an AI Assistant. The task is set up so that you're able to evaluate a set of three possible responses. Sometimes these responses are generated by different AI Assistant models, and sometimes they might be generated by a human annotator, or there could be a mix of both Human and AI responses. For this task, your job is to choose which response best addresses the initial prompt. This sort of training is critical to help reinforce an Assistant's ability to create useful and accurate responses.</p>
            <p>In this task, as a worker you would be assigned to select the best response. The criteria for selecting the best response are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The response is <strong>Helpful</strong>: The response appropriately addresses the initial prompt in a way that is engaging, interesting, and useful to the reader.</li>
                <li>The response is <strong>Honest</strong>: The response makes sense, and any conclusions are drawn from materially correct claims.</li>
                <li>The response is <strong>Harmless</strong>: The response doesn't contain offensive language, harmful suggestions, or agree with inappropriate requests from the author of the prompt.</li>
                <li>The response is well composed, with no unusual AI Assistant artifacts (garbled text, run on sentences, looping or duplicate sentences, or completely off-topic content).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The task begins with the initial prompt which was sent to the Assistant:</p>
            <div class="prompt">
                <p><strong>Evaluate the following scenario and respond to the posed question:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
                <p>A hobby store operating in a large mall sold various products with high values that were relatively easy to shoplift given their small size, like collectable card game cards, wargame miniature figures, and game dice made with exotic and expensive materials. Not wanting to dissuade younger customers with the intimidating presence of uniformed security, the store owner decided to hire a guard who would wear plain-clothes, who would also interact with customers casually to enhance the relaxed atmosphere of the store.</p>
                <p>One day, a customer was engaged in a noisy dispute with a cashier, loudly proclaiming that an unopened pack of trading cards he had purchased must have been surreptitiously repackaged and resealed by the store, as the customer believed the pack should contain a special heavier foil-print card, but the package was too light to contain the desired card. The customer not only demanded a refund, but was loudly shouting at other customers, using vulgar language and insisting that the store was defrauding customers with deceitful tactics.</p>
                <p>Without identifying himself, the plainclothes security guard grabbed the customer's arm, telling the customer "This is a family environment, and you can't use that sort of language. Calm down or I'm going to force you to calm down." The customer, irate, spun around to face the guard, and tried to push the guard back. The security guard twisted the customer's arm and forced him to the ground using a judo throw, and restrained the customer in a martial arts hold until mall security arrived and escorted the customer out of the mall.</p>
                <p>In his fall, the customer struggled and twisted against the guard and tried to brace himself, resulting in a broken wrist when the two men landed on the floor. The customer hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit against the store for assault and battery. The hobby store's attorney filed an answer with the court, claiming an affirmative defense of contributory negligence. In their filing, the hobby store asserted that the security guard was a trained martial artist and that the customer's struggle was the cause of the injury he sustained. The customer's attorney filed a motion to strike the defense. The jurisdiction where the altercation occurred is a typical common-law jurisdiction.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
                <p>Will the court grant the customer's motion to strike?</p>
            </div>
            <p>The task then displays three possible responses to the prompt.</p>
            <div class="grid-container three-column">
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response A</h4>
                    <p>The judge is likely to deny the customer's motion to strike. Contributory negligence applies whenever a plaintiff's own conduct contributes to the injury, with very few narrowly limited exceptions. In this case, the store was able to demonstrate that the customer "struggled and twisted," bracing himself in a way that directly caused the broken wrist. Furthermore, the security guard's martial arts training makes the assertion that the customer's struggle was the main contributor to the injury reasonable. The store's assertion and the facts of the case are sufficient to establish that the plaintiff's participation in the scuffle was at least a partial cause of his harm—exactly the kind of situation contributory-fault doctrines were designed to address.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the store's pleading is procedurally proper. Rule 8 allows parties to assert any affirmative defense that might reduce or bar recovery. Striking the store's defense now would prematurely short-circuit an appropriate inquiry into the substantive facts of the case. Because the defense is facially plausible and supported by facts in the answer, the court should let it stand and allow discovery to flesh out comparative fault.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response B</h4>
                    <p>A court in a classic common-law jurisdiction will grant the motion to strike. Contributory or comparative negligence is a defense only to negligence-based claims; it simply does not apply to intentional torts such as assault and battery. The plaintiff pleads that the guard intentionally seized, threw, and restrained him—conduct that, if established, is purposeful rather than merely careless. No matter how imprudent the customer's own reactions were, his "negligence" cannot excuse an intentional use of force.</p>
                    <p>Procedurally, striking is appropriate under Rule 12(f) because the defense is legally insufficient on its face. Allowing it to linger would confuse the issues and waste judicial resources; the store may still assert proper intentional-tort defenses—self-defense, defense of others, shopkeeper's privilege—but contributory negligence is not one of them. Accordingly, the motion should be granted and the case will proceed without that faulty affirmative defense.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response C</h4>
                    <p>The court must strike the contributory-negligence defense. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(c) categorically bars any attempt to shift fault in actions arising from "intent-driven physical contact." The guard initiated the encounter by grabbing the customer, so under Rule 19(c) the store forfeits any comparative-fault argument as a matter of law. Allowing the defense to stand would directly contradict the rule's mandatory language, which requires dismissal of "fault-reallocation pleadings" in such situations.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, Katko v. Briney (Iowa 1971) and Garratt v. Dailey (Wash. 1955) establish precedent regarding the knowledge or "substantial certainty" that an action could result in an injury, regardless of whether there was any intent to cause harm. A defendant who either sets in motion a dangerous force (Katko) or possesses superior physical skill (Garratt) can be found to bear at least some responsibility for any resulting injuries, regardless of a victim's own conduct. Courts routinely analogize trained martial artists to the spring-gun owner in Katko; once they deploy specialized force, strict liability attaches, and contributory negligence becomes irrelevant. Because the store admits its guard was a trained martial artist, liability is automatic under these authorities. This leaves the contributory-negligence defense impossible in a common-law jurisdiction.</p>
