        <!-- ======================= Question 1A ======================= -->
        <section class="question-block">
            <h2 class="question-title">Question 1A: Allele Inheritance</h2>
            <p>Imagine a user asked the following request to an AI assistant:</p>
            <div class="prompt">
                <p>"A biologist is attempting to breed a plant that is resistant to a specific fungus but also produces high yields. The biologist has obtained a fungus-resistant plant (Plant E) with the homozygous dominant fungus-resistant trait DD but a homozygous recessive low-yield trait yy. A heterozygous high-yielding Yy sample of a plant (Plant M) that has a heterozygous Dd trait has also been obtained and is crossed with the homozygous plant. The first crop of the crossbreed plants (Plant C) is selected.</p>
                <p>The biologist can cross Plant C with either Plant E, Plant M, or another healthy new crossbreed with the same traits as Plant C. The ultimate goal is a homozygous dominant plant for both fungus resistance and high yield (DDYY). Considering the goal, is Plant E, Plant M, or another Plant C the best option to cross with the new Plant C to give the highest ratio of plants that meet the DDYY goal to plants with a homozygous recessive trait (dd or yy)?"</p>
            </div>
            <p>The following are three solutions that were returned by the AI:</p>
            
            <div class="grid-container two-column" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <div class="response-box" style="grid-column: 1 / 3;">
                    <h4>Response A</h4>
                    <p>There are two goals in this scenario:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a fungus resistant plant breed.</li>
                        <li>Create a high-yielding plant breed.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>A low yield would be contrary to the second goal, but a fungal infection that kills the plant would cause both to fail.</p>
                    <p>Given that, the only potential choice that is guaranteed to have a homozygous fungus-resistant trait is the original Plant E due to its homozygous DD alleles. Both other options risk creating a plant that is vulnerable to the fungus as well as homozygous recessive in terms of yield.</p>
                    <p>As Plant C is likely to carry an allele for high yield itself, The biologist should cross Plant C with Plant E for the highest ratio of desired homozygous fungus-resistant plants to undesired ones that risk the entire crop failing due to fungal infection. Does that help?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response B</h4>
                    <p>Let's take stock of what we have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plant E is a breed with DD and yy alleles.</li>
                        <li>Plant M is a breed with Dd and Yy alleles.</li>
                        <li>Plant C is from the new crop and can have multiple possible allele combinations that match the description, either the same configuration as Plant M or the same with an additional dominant D instead of a recessive d.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All of the above have beneficial dominant alleles. Since we are trying to avoid having low yielding or fungally vulnerable plants, and Plant C can have recessive y alleles, it risks a homozygous recessive trait if it is crossed with another plant from the new crop.</p>
                    <p>To avoid that, the biologist should cross Plant C with Plant M, which is guaranteed to always have at least one dominant allele of each type. The logic for all other pathways is flawed and risks creating a vulnerable plant.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response C</h4>
                    <p>The latest crop in which Plant C was grown has some plants with a set of DD fungus-resistance alleles and some with Dd, Yy, and yy alleles. The selected plant has a dominant and recessive yield allele, putting it at risk of a homozygous recessive trait if crossed with another plant with a recessive allele.</p>
                    <p>It would be a mistake to breed the yielding trait of Plant E into any of the new crops, but it would also be a mistake to choose Plant M, which has the same number of recessive alleles as the other original plant. Instead, the biologist should take advantage of the inherited dominant alleles in the selected plant from the new crop and cross Plant C with another plant like it for the highest ratio of plants that meet the goal to plants that have two recessive alleles of the same trait.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the biologist should cross Plant C with another new crossbred plant from the same crop. Let me know if I can assist further.</p>

                <p>The Falkland steamer duck (Tachyeres brachypterus) is a flightless bird endemic to the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean.

Predation on adults is relatively rare, though it is common for fledglings to be carried away by skua. A certain stretch of coast is settled by a population of 108 Falkland steamer ducks. The abundant nesting territory and rich feeding sites with abundant shellfish allow for rapid population growth. Soon, there is competition for nesting ground and food.

In a distantly related species, grey is found to be dominant over white; however, it is observed that white-eyed and grey-eyed Nifflers cannot be bred together, as the young all die in utero.</p>
                <p>The number of different alleles for this gene is the minimum possible number consistent with the information above.</p>
                <p>Considering only the combinations that result in <strong>viable adult Nifflers</strong>, how many possible combinations of alleles exist for this gene?</p>
            </div>
            <p>If necessary, round your answer to the nearest whole number.</p>
            <p>Please enter your answer as <strong>just the number</strong>, excluding any extra text such as ('combinations').</p>

                <p>A biologist obtains a sample of <em>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</em> and incubates it in a microbiological incubator at 25°C in a YPD liquid culture with a supply of maltose in an airtight sealed flask. It is left to propagate for 8 hours, then it is removed and the amount of growth is measured. This is Experiment 1.</p>
                <p>The following table, Table 1, shows the number of <em>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</em> generations propagated at certain temperatures under the laboratory's standard conditions based on previous observations. Given that an optimal medium would increase propagation by 40%, the presence of glucose (a monosaccharide) as food would increase it another 8%, and a source of nitrogen would increase it another 5%, how many generations are expected to have grown during Experiment 1 when accounting for the fact that fermentation is 50% the rate of aerobic respiration for obligate aerobes but 110% the rate of aerobic respiration for facultative anaerobes?</p>

                <h4>🤖 AI Response</h4>
                <p>To determine how many generations are expected to form in Experiment 1, let's evaluate the situation step by step:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Environment Analysis:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Medium: The experiment is conducted in a YPD liquid culture, or Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose broth. This is a rich medium with a nitrogen source that is often used to propagate yeast, and it is considered an optimal medium for <em>S. pombe</em>.
                                <br><strong>Verdict:</strong> The optimal medium will increase propagation by 40%.</li>
                            <li>Food source: Maltose is provided as the available food source. While this is usable food for <em>S. pombe</em>, it is not as favorable as glucose due to being a more complex disaccharide.
                                <br><strong>Verdict:</strong> Glucose is not present, so there is no propagation increase.</li>
                            <li>Nitrogen: The peptones and yeast extract in YPD contain nitrogen. Therefore, a nitrogen source is present.
                                <br><strong>Verdict:</strong> The presence of a nitrogen source will increase propagation by 5%.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen: The yeast is being incubated in an airtight sealed flask, which is an anaerobic environment. <em>S. pombe</em> is capable of respiration via fermentation, so propagation will occur at 110% the normal rate, meaning an increase in propagation of 10%.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Propagation Calculation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Experiment 1 was carried out at 30°C for 8 hours. Table 1 indicates that 8 hours at 30°C under standard conditions will see 2 generations propagate. Therefore, 2 generations would be expected to propagate in 6 hours at 30°C under standard conditions.</li>
                            <li>Adjusting for the conditions in Experiment 1, the standard propagation is increased by 40% + 5% + 10%:
                                <br>40% + 5% + 10% = 55%</li>
                            <li>2 generations * 0.55 = 1.1 generations</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Final Answer</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The biologist would see 1.1 generations propagated. Despite the airtight environment, the optimal medium, presence of nitrogen, and fermentation allowed for healthy growth.</li>
                            <li>Answer: 1.1 generations</li>
                        </ul>
