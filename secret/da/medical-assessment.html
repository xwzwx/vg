            <p>A 23 year old man and his wife visit a clinician for genetic counseling. The man's sister died from Histone Deacetylase Deficiency (HDAC-D), more commonly known as Kessler-Vance Syndrome. Kessler-Vance Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the enzymes that regulate gene expression by modifying histone proteins. Affected individuals appear normal for the first 18-24 months of life, but then experience a loss of fine motor control, such as crawling or walking, often accompanied by hypotonia. Most affected individuals do not survive past age 10 due to respiratory complications.</p>
            <p>The incidence of Kessler-Vance Syndrome is approximately 1 in 40,000. Assume that the couple is selected from a large, randomly mating population. Given that the wife's family history is noncontributory, the wife's risk for being a carrier of the disorder is closest to:</p>

            <p>A 16 year old boy schedules an appointment with his primary care physician with a complaint of worsening acne. The boy started a course of tetracycline one year ago, and the treatment had been effective for 9 months. Recently the boy's severe acne returned, gradually worsening over the past 3 months. The boy has also put on 24 pounds, 12 of which are muscle.</p>
            <p>Upon being questioned by the doctor about environmental and lifestyle factors, the boy notes that he changed his diet three months ago, as he joined his school's weightlifting club. The boy transitioned from a mostly vegan diet to one with more animal protein. Every morning for breakfast he consumes four eggs and a piece of steak.</p>
            <p>The boy previously took his daily tetracycline dose first thing in the morning, but now delays the pill until after his morning weightlifting workout, as he found his prescription was causing him an upset stomach when taken early in the morning. The boy reports that he still consistently takes his prescription with his post-workout drink, a shake made with whole milk, whey, and vanilla-flavored pea protein powder.</p>
            <p>The physician determines which of the following is the most likely cause of the boy's sudden severe acne flareup?</p>

            <p>A 22 year old woman recently moved to Seattle, and for the past 6 weeks has been suffering from intense headaches. The woman goes to a minor emergency clinic and reports experiencing short, intense headaches she describes as occurring "behind my left eye, like a firecracker explodes and is burning for an hour." The headaches last between 15 minutes and two hours, and she does not have a history of severe headaches.</p>
            <p>All but two of the headaches occurred at night, and the pain was severe enough to cause the woman to awaken. She reports having the headaches most days of the week, and always experiences the headaches on Friday and Saturday after going out drinking with her friends. The woman's vital signs are taken at the minor emergency clinic and are normal.</p>
            <p>The minor emergency clinic physician refers the woman to a neurologist. The neurologist conducts an examination which finds no neurological abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis of the woman's condition?</p>

            <h2 class="question-title">Question 7: Response Comparison</h2>
            <p>Suppose you're working on a task where you are asked to evaluate outputs from an AI Assistant. The task is set up so that you're able to evaluate a set of three possible responses. Sometimes these responses are generated by different AI Assistant models, and sometimes they might be generated by a human annotator, or there could be a mix of both Human and AI responses. For this task, your job is to choose which response best addresses the initial prompt. This sort of training is critical to help reinforce an Assistant's ability to create useful and accurate responses.</p>
            <p>In this task, as a worker you would be assigned to select the best response. The criteria for selecting the best response are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The response is Helpful: The response appropriately addresses the initial prompt in a way that is engaging, interesting, and useful to the reader.</li>
                <li>The response is Honest: The response makes sense, and any conclusions are drawn from materially correct claims.</li>
                <li>The response is Harmless: The response doesn't contain offensive language, harmful suggestions, or agree with inappropriate requests from the author of the prompt.</li>
                <li>The response is well composed, with no unusual AI Assistant artifacts (garbled text, run on sentences, looping or duplicate sentences, or completely off-topic content).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The task begins with the initial prompt which was sent to the Assistant:</p>
            <div class="prompt">
                <p>An 81 year old woman is taken to the hospital after breaking her wrist in a fall. Her son reports that the woman bumped into a coffee table and then tripped on the corner of a couch, and broke her wrist when bracing herself in her fall. The elderly woman initially claimed that she was fine, but her son grew alarmed when he noticed severe swelling and discoloration of his mother's hand and wrist.</p>
                <p>The ER physician conducted confrontational visual-field testing and found left lower quadrant quadrantanopia. The physician then applied simultaneous tactile stimulation bilaterally, but the patient was only able to correctly identify the right-side sensation. The woman is otherwise lucid and proprioception is present.</p>
                <p><strong>Which of the following is the physician's most likely initial diagnosis?</strong></p>
                <ol type="A" style="list-style-position: inside; padding-left: 0;">
                    <li>A lesion of the right parietal lobe</li>
                    <li>A lesion of the left parietal lobe</li>
                    <li>A lesion of the right frontal lobe</li>
                    <li>A lesion of the left frontal lobe</li>
                    <li>Hemisensory loss consequent to a concussion resulting from the fall</li>
                    <li>Déjerine-Roussy syndrome</li>
                    <li>Cardioembolic Shower</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>You are then presented with the following three responses:</p>
            <div class="grid-container three-column">
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response A</h4>
                    <p>The physician is most likely to suspect a lesion of the right parietal lobe. This is a textbook right parietal lesion, as proven by the left inferior quadrantanopia, which arises when Meyer's loop in the right parietal lobe is disrupted; parietal fibers carry the lower visual field and are uniquely vulnerable after minor trauma in the elderly. The bilateral touch finding reflects primary sensory loss on the left—extinction means the dorsal columns are impaired—even though bedside proprioception can paradoxically remain normal early on. The observed difficulty moving through a familiar space resulting in a serious fall confirms ipsilateral neglect, a hallmark of right-hemisphere parietal damage. Because the clinical pattern definitively localizes the lesion, empiric therapy should proceed. The conservative approach is to begin with an IV infusion 5mg/kg Methylprednisolone to arrest cortical edema. CT angiography is contraindicated here as it exposes the patient to contrast that can worsen reperfusion injury; MRI can be deferred to the outpatient setting once symptoms stabilize.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response B</h4>
                    <p>The correct answer is A, A lesion of the right parietal lobe. The exam findings form a coherent right parietal syndrome. A left inferior quadrantanopia arises when fibers carrying the lower-left visual field are disrupted within the right parietal optic radiations. On somatosensory testing, extinction of left-sided stimuli during simultaneous bilateral touch with otherwise intact primary sensation reflects an attentional deficit from right parietal association cortex dysfunction. Her tendency to bump into furniture is consistent with left hemispatial neglect rather than primary sensory loss. Taken together, these features localize to a single cortical locus that explains both the visual field defect and the spatial-attention impairment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response C</h4>
                    <p>The most likely initial diagnosis is G) Cardioembolic Shower. This presentation suggests multifocal ischemia best explained by a cardioembolic shower. In an elderly patient, silent atrial fibrillation or valvular disease can seed numerous microemboli to disparate vascular territories; a left inferior quadrantanopia points to occipital/posterior cerebral involvement, while the abnormal bilateral tactile test reflects concomitant thalamocortical sensory interruption. The fall may even represent an arrhythmic presyncopal event antecedent to the embolic cascade. On diffusion-weighted MRI, one would expect punctate lesions across multiple distributions (MCA and PCA), a hallmark of embolic showers rather than a single-territory stroke. Given the high pretest probability of cardiac sources in this age group, the most prudent initial diagnosis is cardioembolism with scattered infarcts. Immediate work-up should prioritize ECG monitoring for paroxysmal AF, transthoracic/TEE for intracardiac thrombus, and early secondary prevention with anticoagulation once imaging confirms the pattern.</p>
