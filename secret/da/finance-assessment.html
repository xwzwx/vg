        <section class="question-block">
            <h2 class="question-title">Question 1: DDM</h2>
            <p>Consider the following two companies:</p>
            <div class="grid-container two-column">
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>The Voight-Kampff Company</h3>
                    <p>The Voight-Kampff Company's current return on equity is 16%. It pays out one-quarter of earnings as cash dividends. The book value per share of Voight-Kampff's stock is $35. The company has 2.79 million shares outstanding. Over the next four years, the ROE and payout ratio remain constant. After that, competition from upstart Tyrell Corporation forces Voight-Kampff's return on equity down to 10%, and the company increases its payout ratio to 50%. The company does not plan to issue new or retire current shares. The cost of capital remains constant at 9.5%.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Mellow Destinations Incorporated</h3>
                    <p>Mellow Destinations Incorporated has a return on equity of 19%, and pays 30% of earnings as cash dividends. The book value of a share of Mellow Destinations stock is $15.5. The company has 4.4 million shares outstanding. Over the next 8 years, the ROE and payout ratio remain constant. After this period, a softening of the market results in Mellow Destinations' ROE decreasing to 14%. As a consequence, Mellow Destinations decides to lower its payout ratio to 18%. The company does not plan to issue or retire shares. The cost of capital remains constant at 15%.</p>

The beta computed from this data for Nemur & Strauss is 0.75, and for Transnational Genetic Technologies, Inc. the beta is 0.58.

            </ul>
            <p>We assume the Capital Asset Pricing Model is accurate, and that the expected future market risk premium is 0.55% per month. The risk-free interest rate remains a constant 0.35% per month.</p>

        <!-- ======================= Question 3: Options ======================= -->
        <section class="question-block">
            <h2 class="question-title">Question 3: Options</h2>
            <p>Today is July 1. Four months ago, in February 2025, a single farmer received an inheritance which included 1,800 shares of a premium automotive parts manufacturing company stock, Gotta Go Fast (GGF). The value of the stock has been changing quickly. When the farmer received the inheritance, the stock was valued at $9 per share. Last month the price was as high as $33.27. Currently, the stock is valued at a price of $22 per share.</p>
            <p>The farmer is planning to make a series of expensive improvements to his property next year. The farmer expects that the time required to complete the improvements will result in significantly lower income for the year, and he would prefer to defer selling the stock until next March to improve his tax situation. The farmer estimates that this year he'll have an adjusted gross income between $104,000 and $110,000, but next year he expects the consequence of the time required to complete the improvements to his farm to reduce his income by roughly 33%.</p>
            <p>Contingent to completing the planned improvements the farmer must make down payments totaling $50,000, and the farmer will need to sell his inherited shares to cover this cost. The farmer is worried about the price risk if he decides to hold onto his shares until next year. He already has some money saved, but if the value of his shares drops below $35,000 he will be unable to afford the necessary down payments. However, if the value of the stock increased, he could have a cash cushion to help offset next year's lower anticipated income.</p>
            <p>The farmer is conflicted, and doesn't have much experience with stocks. He considers selling the stock today. The farmer sees this option as attractive, because the geopolitical situation as reported in the news threatens much higher oil prices in the near future. The farmer is worried that this could cause the value of his shares to plummet if people can't afford premium auto parts. Anxious and confused by the tax burden of his situation, the farmer decides to consult with a friend who is more familiar with stocks and investments. The farmer's friend considers the farmer's situation, and offers four different options as suggestions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Option 1:</strong> The first option is to write March call options today on the GGF shares with a $27 strike price. These calls are currently selling for $3 each.</li>
                <li><strong>Option 2:</strong> The second option is to purchase March put options today on GGF with a strike price of $25. These put options currently sell for $3.50 each.</li>
                <li><strong>Option 3:</strong> The third option is to create a collar by both writing the March call options and buying the March put options today.</li>
                <li><strong>Option 4:</strong> Sell the shares of GGF today, locking in the current price per share.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="sub-question-title">Question 3a</h3>
            <p>Which of the options suggested above will guarantee the farmer meets his financial goal for the improvements to his farm? For the purpose of this question, we can assume that the farmer's estimate of his income for this year and next year is accurate. We also assume that the farmer is located in the United States, and lives in a state which does not levy personal income tax on capital gains. Furthermore, we'll assume that each option has the same negligible cost with respect to any brokerage fees.</p>

        <!-- ======================= Question 4: Futures ======================= -->
        <section class="question-block">
            <h2 class="question-title">Question 4: Futures</h2>
            <p>Suppose you're working on a task where you are asked to evaluate outputs from an AI Assistant. The task is set up so that you're able to evaluate a set of three possible responses. Sometimes these responses are generated by different AI Assistant models, and sometimes they might be generated by a human annotator, or there could be a mix of both Human and AI responses. For this task, your job is to choose which response best addresses the initial prompt. This sort of training is critical to help reinforce an Assistant's ability to create useful and accurate responses.</p>
            <p>In this task, as a worker you would be assigned to select the best response. The criteria for selecting the best response are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Helpful:</strong> The response appropriately addresses the initial prompt in a way that is engaging, interesting, and useful to the reader.</li>
                <li><strong>Honest:</strong> The response makes sense, and any conclusions are drawn from materially correct claims.</li>
                <li><strong>Harmless:</strong> The response doesn't contain offensive language, harmful suggestions, or agree with inappropriate requests from the author of the prompt.</li>
                <li><strong>Well composed,</strong> with no unusual AI Assistant artifacts (garbled text, run on sentences, looping or duplicate sentences, or completely off-topic content).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The task begins with the initial prompt which was sent to the Assistant:</p>
            <div class="prompt">
                <p><strong>Evaluate the following scenario and respond to the farmer's conclusion:</strong></p>
                <p>Each January, a resort restaurant contracts with a local farm to deliver fresh mangoes in the months of July, August, and September. The restaurant uses the mangoes in a number of dishes, including its signature mango ice cream, which is especially popular with tourists in the summer. To maintain customer loyalty, the restaurant keeps its dessert prices stable, regardless of seasonal fluctuations in ingredient costs.</p>
                <p>Mango prices are highly volatile. In bumper crop years, prices can fall as low as $1.20 per kilogram, while in poor harvest years they can spike to $4.50 per kilogram or more. To avoid this volatility, the restaurant and the farm enter a futures contract in January, agreeing to a fixed price of $2.75 per kilogram for the entire summer delivery. The total contract covers 3,000 kilograms of mangoes, delivered evenly across the three months.</p>
                <p>In the year in question, a severe drought strikes major mango-producing regions. By mid-July, the spot market price rises to $4.60/kg. Despite this, the farmer fulfills the contract and delivers mangoes at the previously agreed price of $2.75/kg.</p>
                <p>After the season ends, the farmer remarks:</p>
                <p><em>"I did everything right, and still lost out. If I hadn't signed that contract, I could have made almost $6,000 more."</em></p>
            </div>
            <p>The task then displays three possible responses to the prompt.</p>
            
            <div class="grid-container three-column">
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response A</h4>
                    <p>The farmer made a sound financial decision by locking in a futures contract. While the spot price eventually rose to $4.60/kg, such an outcome is rare and shouldn't bias the evaluation of a hedge. The purpose of the hedge is to maximize expected value based on historical price data, not hindsight.</p>
                    <p>Historically, mango prices have ranged from $1.20/kg in high-supply years to $4.50/kg in low-supply years. To estimate the expected spot price, we use a weighted average formula that accounts for supply conditions: E[P] = ($1.20*0.6+$4.50*0.6) / 2 = $3.42</p>
                    <p>While this year's spot price was unusually high, such outcomes are not predictable. The $2.75/kg hedge offered a safer, more stable return and avoided downside losses. Given the weighted expected value and margin stability, the farmer made a prudent and financially rational decision.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response B</h4>
                    <p>In retrospect, the farmer's use of a futures contract appears to have been financially suboptimal. While hedging is commonly used to reduce exposure to price fluctuations, in this instance the hedge failed to protect the farmer's long-term financial interest and instead resulted in a significant opportunity cost.</p>
                    <p>By agreeing in advance to a fixed price, the farmer forfeited the ability to benefit from favorable market movements. In the year in question, poor weather conditions caused a substantial decline in supply and a corresponding surge in spot prices. Had the farmer remained unhedged, they would have been able to sell their crop at a much higher market price, significantly increasing their revenue.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the futures contract—while well-intentioned—ultimately imposed a financial constraint that harmed the farmer's economic outcome.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="response-box">
                    <h4>Response C</h4>
                    <p>The farmer's decision to enter into a futures contract was not a mistake, even though it resulted in a lower realized price than the spot market ultimately offered. This is a classic example of hedging—a strategy used to reduce exposure to unfavorable price movements in volatile markets.</p>
                    <p>Hedging is not intended to maximize profit; it is intended to minimize risk. From a financial perspective, the goal is to reduce the variance in outcomes, particularly those that could result in severe losses or insolvency. When the farmer signed the futures contract, the future market price of mangoes was unknown. The agreed-upon price served as a form of price insurance, protecting the farmer from the possibility that prices would fall well below production costs.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, the futures contract served its purpose: it allowed the farmer to plan with certainty, manage costs, and avoid the financial distress that could arise in a low-price scenario. In this sense, the farmer's decision reflects prudent financial management.</p>
